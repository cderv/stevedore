        "pdf" (or an abbreviation).  By default it uses the value
        `getOption("help_type")` and should follow the same

    summary: >-
      Run a command in a new container
    description: |
      This method does rather a lot, and wraps several other methods.
      It aims to mimic the behaviour of `docker run` in the command
      line tool.  It will:

      - Try to pull a container if it does not yet exist (see
        `$images$pull`; `docker_image_collection`)
      - Create the container (see `$containers$create`;
        `docker_container_collection`)
      - Start the container (see `$start`; `docker_container`)
      - Optionally stream the logs, if not detached (see
        `$logs`, `docker_container`
      - Wait for the container to finish (see `$wait`;
        `docker_container`)

      It returns a list with a container object as
      `"container"` and a `"docker_stream"` object
      containing logs as `"logs"`).  If `rm = TRUE` and
      `detach = TRUE` the container object will be of limited
      utility and you will need to use `reload = FALSE` on many
      methods (and some will not work) as the container will have
      been removed on exit.

      Unlike the command line version, interrupting the streaming
      logs will not necessarily kill the container but may leave it
      running in the background.

      Unlike the command line version, the `attach = TRUE`
      simply attaches the output of the container and blocks
      the R session until it is complete.  There is currently no way
      of sending input into the docker container.
    args:
      image: >-
        Image to run.  Can be a name, id, or a
        `docker_image` object.
      cmd: >-
        Command to run in the container.  Must be a character
        vector.  If not specified then the default `ENTRYPOINT`
        and `CMD` will be used (see the docker documentation
        for details)
      "...": >-
        Additional arguments passed through to `$create` (see
        `docker_container_collection`.  There are many
        possible arguments here.
      detach: >-
        Detach the container as soon as it has started and return
        control to R.  The container will run in the background.
        The returned object can be used to interrogate the container
        afterwards (see `docker_container`).
      rm: >-
        Remove the container on exit.
      stream: >-
        The stream to use to send output to, if `detach =
        FALSE`.  The default uses the standard output stream (i.e.,
        where `cat` would send output).  Other valid
        values are an R connection object, a string (interpreted as
        a filename) or `FALSE` to prevent any output.
      host_config: >-
        Passed through to `$create`, as with `...`.
