# docker spec

These come from:

    https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/{version}/swagger.yaml

e.g.

    https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.29/swagger.yaml
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.29

The package will always include one _reasonably current_ spec file; currently this is v1.29; this will be the default version
